Hi! This is a guide on how to run the project and some details that are important to understand the implementation.
This project is the Inclusion Coding Challenge, it is based on a provided design.
For this implemenation, the original design was adapted to ReactJS, and everything was separated into react components.

## Preconditions
This projecty requieres node version `v14.18.2`

## How to run the project :runner:
In order to see the whole project runing, the user has to: 
1.  Clone or download the repository 
2. Run the command `npm install` to install all the dependencies 
3. Run `npm start`, this will open the navigator and you will be able to see the project.

## Time interval modification 
To modify the time interval of the requests you can navigate to `src/Components/StatusCard/index.js`. Here you will find a comment where the time interval is set in milliseconds.

Initially, all of the status cards will show an error. Don't panic! This lasts only for a few seconds. :D
